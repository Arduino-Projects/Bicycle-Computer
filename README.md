# Arduino Bicycle Computer
A custom made bicycle computer that tracks your RPM, Speed, Calories Burned, along with many other useful statistics, and then displays them on a Touch Screen TFT Display


# How It Works
- By wiring 2 main hall effect sensors(magnetic sensors), one on the pedal and the other on the front tire, and wiring them to an Arduino
- The Arduino reads in the data, performs some mathematical calculations, runs some code, and then displays the stats in a graphical, user friendly manner to the biker


# Open-Source Libraires Used
Make sure to download all of the required libraries before running any of the programs  
http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=51 (UTFT Display Library)  
http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=59 (UTFT Geometry Library)  
http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=92 (Touchscreen Library)  
Credits to Henning Karlsen for all the amazing work with the libraries.  

After downloading the libraries, run the calibration sketch, and type the values you receive in the Bicycle Computer Sketch  


# Why I Built This
- This was my first real project
- I had a passion for both biking, and programming so I thought hey, why not combine the two?
- Took approximately 3-4 days to make from end to end


# Youtube Video
To better document my first project, I created a youtube video giving detailed, step by step instructions on how to build the Arduino Bicycle Computer
